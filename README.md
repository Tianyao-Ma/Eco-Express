## üé¨ About the project
<p align="justify"> 
  a full-stack web application that provides city-wide delivery service using eco-friendly agent like robots and drones with personalized recommendation feature
  Delivery and online shopping became the new norm. Trunk and small vehicles are still the main tranportation. Drones and AI also became more and more intelligent and reliable. Can we combine them together and make the delivery path greener?
  We built  a Dispatch & Delivery Management Web Application. The service is to deliver small to medium scale items to residents in San Francisco using drones or robots.
We now have 3 dispatching centers in the city.
Users can sign up or login on our application, place or cancel orders, view history orders, and track ongoing orders.
We provide customized  delivery recommendations for customers according to their needs.
